# DataStructures-BinarySearchTreeProject
In this project, I created a binary search tree (BST) from each line of given file and linked these trees together using a singly linked list. Each line in the file will be used to costruct a separate BST, where the characters in the line will form the nodes the tree.The ASCII value of each character can be used for comparison when inserting nodes into the tree.

The total value of a tree will be calculated as follows:
The sum of twice the value of the nodes in the left subtree plus the sum of the values of the nodes in the right subtree.

When the user presses the W key, the selected tree must be mirrored (flipped).

The trees should be stored in a singly linked list and displayed sequentially. If the number of nodes in the list exceeds the screen limit, only 10 nodes should be shown at a time. Users can navigate through the list using the A and D keys:

Pressing A moves to the previous node (left).
Pressing D moves to the next node (right).
The BST structure of the currently selected node should be drawn on the screen according to the given example.

When the user presses the S key, the selected node along with its corresponding tree must be deleted from the list.
